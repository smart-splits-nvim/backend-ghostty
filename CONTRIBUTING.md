# Contributing

This project targets macOS and Ghostty. Install the toolchain with Homebrew,
then allow Xcode Command Line Tools to finish installing:

```sh
xcode-select --install
brew install neovim stylua lua-language-server luajit luarocks

LUAJIT_PREFIX="$(brew --prefix luajit)"
ROCKS=(--lua-version=5.1 --lua-dir="$LUAJIT_PREFIX" --local)
luarocks "${ROCKS[@]}" install luacheck 1.2.0-1
luarocks "${ROCKS[@]}" install busted 2.3.0
luarocks "${ROCKS[@]}" install nlua 0.3.2
eval "$(luarocks "${ROCKS[@]}" path --bin)"
```

Run the fast checks from the repository root:

```sh
make check
```

This runs formatting, LuaLS, Luacheck, and the focused tests in Neovim. Use
`make format`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, or `make test` individually.
Pass Busted options with `BUSTED_ARGS`, for example:
`make test BUSTED_ARGS='--filter=bridge'`.

## Real Ghostty tests

These require a logged-in macOS desktop, Ghostty 1.3 or newer at
`/Applications/Ghostty.app`, Neovim 0.11 or newer, and macOS Automation
permission.

```sh
make test-e2e
```

The harness launches a separate Ghostty process with
`tests/e2e/ghostty.conf`, so existing sessions can stay open. It runs real
Neovim and Ghostty through smart-splits v2 and v3, using both osascript and the
persistent bridge. It checks split movement, shell movement, resizing,
`Ctrl-Z`/`fg`, key-table lifecycle, and navigation after Neovim exits.
The v3 sessions also check all three `move.at_edge` modes at the outer edge
and with existing neighbors, directional pane creation, navigation out of
split zoom, and navigation in native macOS fullscreen. Each direction is
tested with both transports. Fullscreen tests temporarily switch macOS Spaces.

Bridge sessions verify a real bridge child process and reject any osascript
fallback after initial attachment. The upstream v2/v3 checkouts are downloaded
to ignored `deps/` when needed; override them with `SMART_SPLITS_DIR` and
`SMART_SPLITS_V3_DIR`.

E2E is local-only because it needs a graphical session and Automation
permission. It is excluded from `make check` and CI.

## Benchmark

`make bench` builds the bridge and launches its own Ghostty instance and window.
Existing sessions can stay open. It measures real osascript and bridge
round-trips in two temporary panes, prints latency statistics, and closes the
test instance.

```sh
make bench
make bench BENCH_ARGS='--pairs 30 --warmup 4 --json /tmp/ghostty-bench.json'
```

Leave the benchmark window alone until it finishes. A forced interruption may
leave that disposable window open.

## Automation and bridge

The osascript transport and Swift bridge share [`scripts/ghostty.js`](scripts/ghostty.js)
and address the Ghostty process owning the current Neovim instance. Build the
bridge with `make bridge`; syntax-check the scripts with:

```sh
tmpdir="$(mktemp -d)"
trap 'rm -rf "$tmpdir"' EXIT
osacompile -l JavaScript -o "$tmpdir/ghostty.scpt" scripts/ghostty.js
osacompile -l JavaScript -o "$tmpdir/tests.scpt" tests/ghostty.js
```

Use Conventional Commit prefixes such as `fix:` and `feat:`. Changes to
navigation, lifecycle handling, or the bridge should
include `make test-e2e` results when possible.
